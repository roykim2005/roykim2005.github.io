Welcome! I am an undergraduate Physics and Aerospace Engineering major at UT Austin.

My goal is to pursue a PhD in Physics, contributing to the intersection of **theoretical modeling** and **experimental systems design**.

I am also involved in small-scale space systems research, particularly a **3U CubeSat project** focusing on physics-oriented applications.

In my free time, I play guitar, train MMA, lift weights, and solve Rubik's cube.

I'm a follower of Jesus Christ. If you’re interested, you can read testimonies from university faculty members [here](https://meettheprof.com/).
