**Teaching**  
I work as a Physics Learning Assistant (undergraduate TA). I assisted PHY 302L: General Physics Technical Course: Electricity and Magnetism, Light, Atomic and Nuclear Physics for Fall 2025, and I will be assisting PHY 317L: General Physics II for premedical students for Spring 2026.

I tutor high school level subjects including SAT math, calculus, and physics, as well as college level math and physics including complex analysis, linear algebra, and moden physics.
