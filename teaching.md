# **Teaching**
I'm an undergraduate TA (learning assistant) for PHY 302L: General Physics Technical Course: Electricity and Magnetism, Light, Atomic and Nuclear Physics (Fall 2025).

I tutor high school level subjects including SAT math, calculus, and physics, as well as college level calculus, differential equations, vector calculus, linear algebra and complex analysis.
