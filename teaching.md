**Teaching**  
I'm an undergraduate TA (learning assistant) for PHY 302L: General Physics Technical Course: Electricity and Magnetism, Light, Atomic and Nuclear Physics (Fall 2025).

I tutor high school level subjects including SAT math, calculus, and physics, as well as college level math and physics including complex analysis, linear algebra, and moden physics. You can find more information here: [SAT math](https://www.superprof.com/sat-math-austin-physics-engineering-student-with-99th-percentile-sat-score-available-korean-and-english.html) and [College math/physics](https://www.superprof.com/college-level-math-and-physics-austin-physics-aerospace-engineering-student-calc-diffeq-vectorcalc-linalg-complex.html).

I have experience in sports coaching. After retiring from my career as a national taekwondo athlete, I served as a founder/head coach at Gilbert Christian High School Taekwondo Club in high school, later coached adults and athletes at Gilbert Tae Kwon Do School.
