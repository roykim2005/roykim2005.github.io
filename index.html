Welcome! I am an undergraduate physics major with broad interests in mathematical physics, AMO physics, plasma physics, high-energy-density and high-energy physics. My current research lies somewhere between finite-temperature field theory and AdS/CFT correspondence.

My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in physics, contributing to the intersection of **theoretical modeling** and **experimental high-energy/AMO systems**.

I am also involved in small-scale space systems research, particularly a **3U CubeSat project** focusing on physics-oriented applications.
