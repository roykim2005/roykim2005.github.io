**Research Interests**  
I'm a mathematical physicist interested in AMO physics and high-energy density physics, especially in laser-plasma interaction. I originally started my research in high-energy theory, studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. My current project focuses on a little bit of finite-temperature field theory and a little bit of AdS/CFT, and a whole lot of mathematical physics.

**Current Research**   
### Operator-Theoretic Regularization of Divergent Logarithmic Series
A study of the spectral decomposition of discrete imaginary modes and exploring applications in AdS/CFT correspondence and finite-temperature quantum field theory in Euclidean formalism.

**Project**   
### Project Romulus
Multipurpose 3U cube satellite at project focused on developing feasible applications for AMO physics in low Earth orbit.
