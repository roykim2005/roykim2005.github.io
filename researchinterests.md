**Research Interests**  
I'm a mathematical physicist interested in AMO physics. I originally started my research in high-energy theory, studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. I have two projects, one in mathematical physics focusing on finite-temperature field theory, and one in experimental physics building the world’s most intense high-flux cold atom beam.

**Current Research**   
### Operator-Theoretic Regularization of Divergent Logarithmic Series
A study of the spectral decomposition of discrete imaginary modes and exploring applications in finite-temperature quantum field theory in Euclidean formalism.

### New Intense Cold Atom Source @ [Ultracold Atomic Physics Group](https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~coldatom/)
[See project description here](https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~coldatom/CAS.html).


I'm currently working on implementing Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) locking of a laser to an optical reference cavity and designing a stable optical cavity providing MHz-level linewidth and sub-MHz/day drift, sufficient for stable laser cooling and diagnostics. 


**Side Project**   
### Project Romulus
Multipurpose 3U cube satellite at project focused on developing feasible applications for AMO physics in low Earth orbit.
