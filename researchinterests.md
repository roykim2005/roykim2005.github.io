**Research Interests**  
I am interested in experimental and theoretical AMO physics. I originally started my research in high-energy theory, studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. Now I have two projects, one in mathematical physics focused on analytic approaches to finite-temperature field theory, and one in experimental physics building an ultrastable cavity for our high-flux cold atom beam.

**Current Research**   
### Operator-Theoretic Regularization of Divergent Logarithmic Series
A study of the spectral decomposition of discrete imaginary modes and their applications in finite-temperature field theory in Euclidean formalism.

### New Intense Cold Atom Source @ [Ultracold Atomic Physics Group](https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~coldatom/)
[See project description here](https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~coldatom/CAS.html).

I'm currently working on implementing Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) locking of a laser to an optical reference cavity and designing a stable optical cavity providing MHz-level linewidth and sub-MHz/day drift, sufficient for stable laser cooling and diagnostics. 


**Side Project**   
### A Dynamical Analysis of Espresso Flow
A theoretical study of non-Newtonian porous media flow and thermal coupling in espresso extraction through anisotropic coffee pucks to help you produce a good cup of coffee every morning.
